# Language-Detection-Model
Developed a machine learning model to identify the language of a given text input with high accuracy. The system uses NLP techniques and character/word frequency analysis to differentiate between multiple languages. Useful for applications like multilingual chatbots, content categorization, and text preprocessing in AI systems.
